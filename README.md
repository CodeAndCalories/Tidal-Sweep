# Tidal-Sweep
Navigate the ocean floor. Avoid the jellyfish. Clear the depths. Tidal Sweep is an ocean-themed tile-sweeping puzzle game inspired by classic grid-based logic games. Explore underwater terrain, use number clues to locate hidden jellyfish, and flag them before they sting you — all while marine life drifts through the deep.
